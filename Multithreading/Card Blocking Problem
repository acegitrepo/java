You need to provide a design for blocking of an Debit card and send the notification to the end user.

As a solution, I created two different threads, one for “Card Blocking” and another for “Notification Sending”. 
I bind the “Notification sending” thread with “Card Blocking” thread thru join() method, so that notification could be sent after the 
blocking of card.

 As per Vikram, as a better alternative, instead of using join(), we can create a thread for blocking the card and then start an 
 async thread for notification from within the same thread.
